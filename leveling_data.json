      "This guide is intended to get a 5-man group from level 60 to 70 in the most efficient way:\n\n• to level 70 by generally avoiding leveling in the open world;\n• to obtain all heroic keys\n• to obtain the Shadow Labyrinth, Shattered Halls, and Arcatraz keys\n• to attune to Karazhan\n• to summon Nightbane in first raid ID",
      "General Tips:\n• the group's professions should cover herbalism and mining to gather resources within dungeons, enchanting to disenchant unneeded blues and greens to save space and gather enchanting materials, and tailoring to turn cloth into bolts to save space\n• bring a few pieces of hit gear for when you start missing mobs again in the mid-60s. More hit = faster clears\n• study your group's pre-raid BIS lists and adjust route to obtain pre-raid BIS items if there's wiggle room\n• Going back to Orgrimmar every level could be a time waster. Each class should carefully review their new spells to decide whether it's worth taking a break to learn new abilities at 61, 63, 65 etc. If you must go back to Org, take advantage of ghetto hearth in RFC to get back quickly",
      "Disclaimer:\nThis info was stolen from many different online resources and content creators. This is what I believe to be the best route based on their collective work and resources.\n\nPublished data on experience per dungeon run is wildly inconsistent. Actual number of runs to reach next level may vary (and for that reason are rarely discussed).\n\nFor best results, the group should be AQ40/Naxx appropriately geared when it goes through the Dark Portal"

      "name": "*** Week 1 Nightbane Attunement *** \n\nYou must be honored with the Violet Eye to begin the Nightbane attunement. At this point, you should be around 2,355/3000 into neutral. To get to honored, run a full Karazhan run but SKIP SHADE OF ARAN (~6,000 Violet Eye rep). During that run, complete the following quests that can be found in and around Karazhan:\n\n• The Violet Eye (75 Violet Eye rep)\n• Assessing the Situation (250 Violet Eye rep)\n• Keanna's Log (250 Violet Eye rep)\n• A Demonic Presence (250 Violet Eye rep)\n• The New Directive (3,000 Violet Eye rep)\n\nNow that you're honored, go outside and pick up the quest \"Medivh's Journal.\" Go back inside to complete the quest (250 Violet Eye rep), and complete the following quests that involve talking to NPCs in Karazhan:\n\n• In Good Hands (10Violet Eye rep)\n• Kamis (10 Violet Eye rep)\n\nNext, pick up the quest \"The Shade of Aran\" and complete it by killing the Shade of Aran (250 Violet Eye rep). \n\nBefore zoning out, pick up and complete the quest \"The Master's Terrace.\"\n\nGo outside to turn in the quest \"The Master's Terrace\" (250 Violet Eye rep).\n\nDrop raid, and pick up and complete the quest \"Digging up the Past\" (250 Violet Eye rep).\n\nPick up the quest \"A Colleague's Aid\" and turn it in at Area 52 (75 Violet Eye rep).\n\nPick up the quest \"Kalynna's Request\" in Area 52. This requires you to kill the first bosses in both Heroic Shattered Halls and Heroic Sethekk Halls. Return to Area 52 to turn the quest in (250 Violet Eye rep).\n\nFinally, pick up the quest \"Nightbane\" in Area 52. Go back to Karazhan as part of a raid, summon and kill Nightbane, loot the Faint Arcane Essence from his corpse, and turn the quest in outside to receive the Blackened Urn to summon Nightbane each week (3,000 Violet Eye rep).\n\n*** Closing Thoughts on Nightbane ***\n\nI recommend completing the Karazhan run (sans Nightbane) on your team's first raid night. I also recommend that each member of the 10-man team complete the questchain together so that more people can summon Nightbane and you're not reliant on one or two people always showing up to kill Nightbane. Between raid night 1 and raid night 2, the 10-man team should split into 2 teams of 5 and go run both Heroic Shattered Halls and Heroic Sethekk Halls to complete the Nightbane pre-quest. Finally, I recommend that the full 25-man raid team kill Gruul's Lair and Magtharidon's Lair on raid night 2, and then your team go back into Karazhan after to kill Nightbane.\n\nCongratulations, you've beaten WOW TBC Anniverary Phase 1 in less than a week.",
